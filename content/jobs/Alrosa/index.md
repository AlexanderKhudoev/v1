When I studied in the magistracy at the Faculty of Automated Control Systems of LSTU,
I already combined study and work, since 2 days were free.

As a graduate student, I was entrusted with an interesting project, which consisted in the development of a bunker rack
for processing fluxes in the Trace Mode 6 environment.

I was engaged in the interface development for the interaction between the user and the hardware devices,
solved the following problems: <br /><br />

- Design of the graphical interface of the bunker conveyor in FBD and SFC languages
- Logic filling control of the containers with fluxes depending on the weight in the ST procedural language
- Programming of strain gauges and opening of bunker covers for unloading fluxes onto a conveyor in the IL procedural language.
- Programming the movement of the conveyor belt
