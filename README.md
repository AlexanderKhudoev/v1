## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. <br/>

## ðŸ“Œ Troubleshooting

Most build problems can be caused by the wrong `node_modules` folder,
so to solve problems, I recommend running these commands and actions:

1. `npm cache clean --force`
2. delete `node_modules` folder
3. delete `yarn-lock.json` file
4. `yarn install`

Also, if you have some errors, try to kill all node.exe processes via Task Manager, and reopen the IDE.

## P.S.

The core of this project and design was developed by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/). <br/>
I filled and improved this template with all sorts of features.
